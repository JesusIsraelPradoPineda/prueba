## Questions about the class

**Why a developer, who is good at both low-level and high-level programming languages, would normally use a high-level language when writing programs?**

It is known as a High Level Programming Language, any programming language that has a well-established structure and with a unique level of flexibility, they have an understandable algorithm for all types of people, whether they are novice or very expert, in addition to their simplicity. It allows a better quality of manipulation and execution of programs created in them, unlike their predecessors, the low and medium level programming languages.(1)

**What is machine code?**

It is the only one that directly understands the computer, it uses the binary alphabet that consists of the only two symbols 0 and 1, called bits (2)

**Give an example of a high-level language**

-  **Basic**

It had the advantage of being really easy to use and learn. That helped many students use it as a first step in programming.

-  **Cobol**

It is used to carry out management applications. It has been improving and evolving over the years and has become one of the most established languages ​​in the world.

-  **Fortran**

Desde siempre ha sido muy popular y ha ido protagonizando varias versiones a lo largo de las décadas, enfocándose al sector técnico y científico.

-  **C**

kind of language that could be separated from the machine and that would facilitate a new way of seeing things. They succeeded and this has led to its functionality being used in all types of sectors (3)

***There are a lot of apps in order to do a high level porgramation"***

**Describe three differences between low-level language and high-level languages**

|Low level|High level  |
|--|--|
| It is my dependent on the machine and cannot migrate to other | Are closer to natural language|
|by the simple fact of being made up of the hardware, it is used to the maximum|These can be migrated to other machines without problems|
|Use of 0 and 1|troubleshoot using EDDS|
|--|--|

**What does a translator do?**

The translator is an essential tool in programming or development, in charge of converting the source code of a certain programming language to machine code that can be "understood" directly by the computer. According to the way they carry out the conversion process, translators are divided into two groups: interpreters and compilers. (5)

**Identify two types of translators that can turn high-level languages into machine code**

**INTERPRETERS**

An interpreter is a translator that executes the lines of code that make up a program one by one and directly. It is a program that reads the source code of another program and executes it as it reads it. The machine code generated at the time of translation is not stored for later execution when requested. Therefore, the program made with a programming language translated by an interpreter will always need the latter to be able to run. There is no independence between the translation and execution phase.


**COMPILERS**

Compiler-type translators convert the source code of a program into machine code, generating on the way an additional resource (an executable) that will be the one we will use to run the program.

In reality, the source program (program with the source code, forgive the redundancy) will be converted, sentence by sentence, to machine code, creating an object program or object code.

***We have 2 types so, I would rather the compiler***


**What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler?**

The differences between interpreter and compiler are:
- An interpreter translates high-level instructions into an intermediate form to be executed. In contrast, a compiler translates high-level instructions directly into machine language.

- The interpreter translates a program line by line while the compiler translates the entire program and then executes it.

- The interpreter detects if the program has errors and allows debugging during the execution process, while the compiler waits until the compilation of the entire program is finished to generate an error report.

- A compiled program is more secure than an interpreted one, because it does not contain the source code, which can be incorrectly modified by the user. (6)

**What is assembly language?**

Assembly language is the programming language used to write low-level computer programs, and is the most direct representation of the specific machine code for each computer architecture readable by a programmer. Even today it is used in the programming of handlers or manipulators of hardware devices.

**A developer is writing a program.**

**a) The program is written in a high-level language and it is then translated into machine code. Describe two differences between high-level language and machine code**

While the high level can be used in several different systems, in a machine language or low level it is only used in a specific hardware, likewise, this only translates into 0 and 1, and in a high level we have the different commands set to have a good understanding


**b) One type of translator is an interpreter.**

-   **1)  Describe how an interpreter translates high-level language programs into machine code?**

An interpreter translates code into machine code, instruction by instruction - the CPU executes each instruction before the interpreter moves on to translate the next instruction. Interpreted code will show an error as soon as it hits a problem, so it is easier to debug than compiled code. An interpreter does not create an independent final set of source code - source code is created each time it runs. Interpreted code is slower to execute than compiled code. (8)

- **b) State the name of a different type of translator that can be used to translate high-level code into machine code?**


A processor for a programming language is a system capable of manipulating programs written in that language in order to execute it or prepare it for execution. This definition is very general, and it contains different systems that manipulate programs: of course compilers and interpreters of programming languages, but also browsers that interpret HTML, databases that execute SQL, advanced text editors such as Textures, printers that they interpret PostScript, any tool that performs a translation / interpretation / compilation process from a formal description of the input.
